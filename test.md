Three CustomDB tables are required to support the application. The table naming does not follow any specific naming conventions. 
              
Recommendations: Use a separate table for each carrier.  Tables can be reused or 
              created afresh. 

Some column names are mandatory, however, the weight break indicator and weight
break rates column names may differ depending on carrier weight breaks.
The primary tables are as follows: (prefixed with an identifier for functional identification)

* Weight Break Rate (wtbrk_rate)
* wtbrk_zone
* wtbrk_weight
